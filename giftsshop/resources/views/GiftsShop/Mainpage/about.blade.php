        <h3>
        In the 4.0 technology era, the demand for online shopping is high and online shopping will help people save
        a lot of time compared to going to the store. So our team decided to build a website where people would get
        all the information about the different products available to them easily. Gifts Online is a project we created
        to sell gifts so that buyers can buy directly on the website without having to go to the store. My team
        advertises by distributing leaflets, television advertisements to attract people to our website selling gifts.
        Frames and a good logo should be used to create the Home Page. Gift item descriptions and photographs
        should be included on the home page. The site should have a menu with options for a quick introduction to
        the many gift products available, the shop's location, and any other information needed.
        Product information should be presented in one of two ways: Information should be available by category,
        with the user being able to click on a certain category and see all of the products connected to that category
        with complete information. For example, a category could be "mugs," "cards," "bracelets," and so on, with
        appropriate sub-categories created. And product information should be organized by brand name. For
        example, if a user wishes to see only "Hallmark" products or any other company's products, he or she can
        click on a link/button/menu and see only those products.
        If a user picks a brand, a list of products associated with that brand is provided. Different product qualities
        should be summarized on the Website page alongside the product, but full features should be saved in
        individual Word documents that may be downloaded or accessed by the User who desires to examine them.
        The customer should also be able to compare products from other brands, both similar and dissimilar.
